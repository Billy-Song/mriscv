This is mRISC-V, AXI-version

NOTES:
Missing ADC, DAC and GPIO interfaces.
Cannot include the SP32B1024 (aka RAM) because disclaimer an alternate version using register will be included.
Generated versions of rc or encounter will not be included, just code.

TODO:
Create makefiles, because shell scripts are garbage.
